# Star Voyager

A Frontier/Elite-style space combat and exploration game set in the Star Trek universe, featuring 2D arcade-style gameplay with SDL graphics.

## Goal

I would like to update this code base to be a bit more secure and see about upgrading to more current libraries. A cross-platform Win32 or MacOS build would also be fun to have. Win32 would open up a lot of people to the game.

I used [Johnny A. Solbu Github](https://github.com/solbu/starvoyager) with all the [Debian patches](https://packages.debian.org/sid/games/starvoyager) as a starting point. Thanks.

- **Shift + Arrows** - Warp speed transition
- **Shift + Down** - Reverse thrust

### Combat

- **Space** - Fire energy weapons (phasers/disruptors)
- **Z** - Fire torpedoes

### Targeting

- **T** - Cycle through nearby ships
- **E** - Target enemy ships only
- **P** - Target planets
- **Shift + T/E/P** - Reverse cycle

- **F6** - Player information
- **F7** - Game options

### Display

- **-/+** - Zoom sensor display
- **/** - Zoom main view
- **Q** - Quit game

## Gameplay Guide

### Ship Systems

- **Shields** - Toggle on/off (drains energy, blocks transporters)
- **Energy** - Powers weapons, shields, and movement
- **Hull** - Ship integrity (repairs available at friendly planets)
- **Fuel** - Required for power generation

### Combat Tips

- Energy weapons auto-target selected enemy
- Torpedoes require line-of-sight and range
- Shields drain energy but provide protection
- Cloaking makes you harder to detect but uses power

### Economy

- Earn credits by destroying enemy vessels
- Purchase fuel, ammunition, and upgrades at planets
- Hail inhabited planets to access services
- Save progress by beaming down to allied planets

### Navigation

- Use sensors to navigate large distances
- Warp speed for interstellar travel
- Mass lock prevents warping near planets
- Target planets for navigation assistance

## Technical Information

### System Requirements
